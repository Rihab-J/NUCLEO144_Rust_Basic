This is a button +  LED example on an embedded device (STM32F4) using rust programming language 

This example is mainly released by following step by step the great article by Jesse Braham [Embedded Rust: From Zero to Blinky](https://beta7.io/posts/embedded-rust-from-zero-to-blinky.html) 
and tweaked for the STM32F412 of the NUCLEO-F412ZG board.
